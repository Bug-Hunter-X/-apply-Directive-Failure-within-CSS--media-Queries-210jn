# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Issue within Media Queries

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive does not function as expected when used inside CSS `@media` queries or other at-rules. The issue is that styles applied within these conditional blocks are sometimes not properly resolved.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies (if any).
3. Open `bug.css` to see the problematic code. 
4. Notice that the expected styles don't apply in the `@media` query due to the failing `@apply` directive.  Compare this to the corrected style in `bugSolution.css`
5. Open `bugSolution.css` to see the corrected approach

## Resolution

The solution, as shown in `bugSolution.css`, involves directly applying the styles in the media query instead of relying on `@apply` within the conditional block.  It's important to maintain correct specificity in cases where you might have conflicting selectors.
